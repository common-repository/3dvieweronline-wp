An easy, realistic and customizable 3D Viewer to embed 3D models of your products/designs into your Wordpress/WooCommerce website (responsive layout)

== Description ==

Embed 3D models into your Wordpress/WooCommerce website thanks to [3DVieweronline](https://www.3dvieweronline.com/). The 3D Viewer is easy to use, highly customizable and it perfectly integrates with Wordpress and WooCommerce.

= About 3DVieweronline =

[3DVieweronline](https://www.3dvieweronline.com/) is a web platform that allows users to upload 3D models and share them through the 3D Viewer. The platform can be embedded in websites or online catalogs and can be viewed on any device. Even mobile devices can use the 3D Viewer and the suite of tools that come with it.

The 3D Viewer Wordpress plugin easily let you embed 3D models into your Wordpress/WooCommerce website. Whether you are selling physical products or 3D model related services, the 3D Viewer will generate much more user engagement than static pictures or technical drawings, boosting your sales. The process is extremely quick and easy, does not require any programming skill or lengthy file conversions since the 3D Viewer directly supports a wide range of 3D file formats (STL, OBJ, STP, IGS, PLY). 

The biggest challenge of selling anything online, from consumer electronics to B2B products, is that potential customers cannot fully understand what they are about to buy. Images and documents are extremely useful, but often not detailed enough, especially in the B2B sector where technical 3D models are very much appreciated. Having that in mind, the 3D Viewer was created to let people thoroughly inspect products with a set of easy and powerful tools, directly from any website. Providing all the details your customers need with realistic 3D renderings, you will grow their confidence in your products and most importantly in your brand.

The 3D Viewer can be seamlessly integrated in any website, thanks to the wide range of features and customization options available. The smart responsive design will adapt to any screen size or device, providing always the best user experience.

Despite 3DVieweronline offers many free services, the embedding feature has been developed for businesses and therefore requires a premium subscription. A 14 days trial is provided to deeply test the 3D Viewer premium features and customisation options.
